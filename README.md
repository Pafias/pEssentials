# pEssentials

This is a small must-have plugin for pretty much any server. It has useful commands and quality-of-life features for
both players and staff

## There are 3 versions of the plugin:

###### Why? No particular reason, I just feel like supporting as many versions as possible :) and it was starting to become a pain to do it all in 1 plugin/codebase as the game and server software evolve over time.

### pEssentials

This is the default version, which is made for the latest versions and thus has newer features that older servers do
not (can not) have.

[Download here](https://pafias.me/minecraft/pEssentials/latest/pEssentials.jar) (**1.18** - latest)

#### Requirements

- **Java 17** or higher
- *(Optional, but recommended) [packetevents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/packetevents-api.80279/)*

### pEssentials Legacy

This is the version that you want to use if you are running an older server version. I cannot give you exact version
ranges, because I haven't thoroughly tested it on every version, but you should be fine. This version should still run
fine on 1.8 - 1.21 (this might change later
on).
