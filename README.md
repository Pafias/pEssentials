# pEssentials
Basically my own minecraft Essentials or something like that
#
JAR file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Pafias/PafiasEssentials/releases/latest/download/pEssentials-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
#
Should work on all versions from 1.9.x to 1.19.x
#
Also runs on 1.7.10 and 1.8.x but doesn't work very well
#
btw, let me know if you want something added! :)
