# pEssentials

This is a small must-have plugin for pretty much any server. It has useful commands and quality-of-life features for both players and staff

Should work on all versions from **1.9.x** to the latest (which is **1.21.x** as of updating this)

Should also run on **1.7.10** and **1.8.x** but may not work very well

Furthermore, I am open for feature requests! :)

## Requirements
- **Java 8** or higher
- *(Optional) [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)*

## Usage
1. Download the latest jar file [here](https://github.com/Pafias/pEssentials/releases/latest)
2. Place it in your `plugins` folder
3. On startup, a config file will be created in `plugins/pEssentials` with a few things you can customize
