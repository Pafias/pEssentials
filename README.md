# PafiasEssentials


Basically my own minecraft Essentials or something like that

If you somehow find this, and want to use it, feel free to.

just don't steal my code :'(
#
JAR file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Pafias/PafiasEssentials/releases/latest/download/PafiasEssentials-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
#
(Currently) Using Paper API 1.19

Tested and compatible with (paper) versions **1.11** & **1.16** & **1.19**

Not tested but also has NMS compatibility for (paper) versions **1.8** & **1.12**

If you didn't understand anything of the past 3 lines: you can use this plugin on versions **1.11**, **1.12**, **1.16** and **1.19**, and maybe on **1.8** (but who the f still uses 1.8 anyway)
#
Written in Java 8 but also exports to 11 and 17 because new mc versions, so it's compatible with the versions between 1.8 and 1.19 ; Until a new version fucks everything again.

btw, let me know if you want something added! :)
